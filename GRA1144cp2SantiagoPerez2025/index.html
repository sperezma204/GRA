	  <section><h3>Steps</h3><ol>
		  <li>When buying, ask for your mojarra or tilapia whole fish to be cleaned and scaled, keeping the head and tail on.</li> 
		  <li>Or do it yourself: Rinse the fish. Leave the head and tail attached. Scrape off the scales with a knife, from tail to head. Slice a shallow line cut along the lower edge of the fish belly, from tail to just before the head. Pull out the entrails. Rinse out its newly empty, interior cavity.</li>
		  <li>Dry the fish with paper towels on both sides.</li>
		  <li>Cut 3 shallow diagonal slices on both sides of the fish&rsquo;s body. This will help cook the fish inside and out.</li>
		  <li>Rub the lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic salt and pepper all over the outside and the inside of the fish.</li>
		  <li>Dredge the fish in the flour, lightly but fully coating both sides, including the head and tail.</li>
		  <li>Add the oil to a pan on a stove-top burner set to a medium-high. The pan should be large enough to fully fit and submerge the whole fish.</li>
		  <li>When the oil is 350&deg;F (if you touch it with the tip of a wooden spoon, the oil will sizzle softly), place the floured fish in the hot oil.</li>
		  <li>Fry for about 8 minutes on the first side, until it is golden brown. With tongs, turn the fish over and fry on the second side for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the size of your fish.</li>
		  <li>When both sides are crispy and medium-brown, and the fish is cooked though, remove it from the hot oil with a slotted spatula or spoon.</li>
		  <li>Set the fish on a paper towel-lined plate to drain the excess oil.</li>
		  <li>Sprinkle a last pinch of garlic salt, lemon zest and squeeze of lemon juice and serve hot.</li>
		  <li>For the arepas, follow the instructions on your Harina P.A.N</li></ol></section>
